# my scripts

### what is this

if you dont know there is a programming language called luau and its for a platform (game) called Roblox. here im coding mods, cheats, and utils. if you want to contribute: thats highly appreciated. its mostly for blox fruits and doors; but i will make scripts for other games too.

in the future i will also open-source a script hub (partially). its just hard open-sourcing on Roblox because people will steal your scripts or developers will use bots to automatically find scripts. this is hard to avoid and ive come to just accept it and continue developing, i also have paid products if you want to buy them that wont get patched 89.6% of the time. (yes, i calculated that percentage)

also make sure to join the **Atlas Discord server:** https://discord.gg/RKEVNpBbHz

### can i use

you can use it; however, you must keep the credits and allow others to find this github repository. additionaly, you should not copy the script, instead you should use the loader code, *which is below*

```lua
local scriptLink = "https://github.com/wello-gh/doors-script/raw/main/main.lua"
loadstring(game:HttpGet(scriptLink))
```

### more info

the `deps` folder is dependencies, they are useful, (i have coded them, but some may not be mine) so thats why i keep them. you can use those but follow the guidelines above (in the can i use section). it would also help if you contributed to my work, actually.
